          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Personal Information:</strong> The personal information we
            collect depends on the type of service, support, or sales inquiry,

card provider. When transferring personal information a security
            icon will appear in your browser.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Cookies and Tracking:</strong> Your Internet browser has
            the in-built facility for storing small text files called
            “cookies” that hold information which allow a website to recognize
            your account. We use cookies to save your preferences and login
            information, and to provide personalized functionality. We may use
            cookies to collect, store, and sometimes track information for
            statistical purposes to improve the products and services we
            provide and to manage our telecommunications networks. More
            specifically, we use different types of cookies for different
            purposes: (i) “required cookies” are necessary for our website to
            work properly, (ii) “performance cookies” allow us to analyze how
            Visitors use our website so we can measure and improve the
            performance of our website, (iii) “functional cookies” allow us to
            remember choices you may have made on our website, and (iv)
            “advertising cookies” are used to present ads that are relevant to
            your interests. We may utilize cookies to track referrals from
            internal and external affiliates, as well as advertising
            campaigns. We may also use a third party service provider to send
            emails that you have agreed to receive. Pixel tags and cookies may
            be used in those email messages to help us measure the
            effectiveness of our advertising and to enable us to provide more
            focused marketing communications to you. You can reject cookies by
            changing your browser settings, but be aware that this will
            disable some of the functionality on our website.

          <p>
            <strong>Customer Surveys:</strong> We may periodically conduct
            customer surveys. Participation in our customer surveys is
            voluntary. However, we encourage our users to participate in these
            surveys because they provide us with important information that
            helps us improve the types of services we offer and how we provide
            them to you. Your personal information, if provided, will remain
            confidential, even if the survey is conducted by a third party
            service provider on our behalf.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Social Media:</strong> Our website includes social media
            features (such as the Facebook “Like” button). These features may
            collect your IP address and which page you are visiting on our
            website, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function
            properly. Social media features and widgets may be hosted by a
            third party or directly on our website. Your interactions with
            these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company
            providing the feature.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Data and Information Submitted to Third Parties on Our Network:</strong>
            This Privacy Policy does not apply to data or personal information
            that may be submitted to, or collected by, third-party websites
            hosted by us or to domain names registered by us. Such websites and
            domain names are not owned or controlled by VEHICULR. You should
            independently evaluate the privacy policies of such third-party
            websites before submitting data or personal information to them
          </p>

          <h3>Information Use</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Personal Information:</strong> The information we collect
            is used for billing and to provide service and support to our
            customers. We may study this information to determine our
            customers’ needs and to promote certain products and services or
            additional support. We may also generate non-identifying and
            aggregate profiles from information that you provide during
            registration (such as the total number of customers in a given
            category). This aggregated and non-identifying information may be
            used to promote advertisements that appear on our website and in
            connection with our services.
          </p>
          <p>
            We take reasonable precautions to prevent unauthorized access to
            your information. Accordingly, we may require you to provide
            additional forms of identity should you wish to obtain information
            about your account details. We may also use the information you
            provide to email VEHICULR newsletters to the primary contact
            e-mail on file, or to contact you about other products or services
            that we think may be of interest.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Log Files:</strong> We use IP addresses to analyze trends,
            administer our site and servers, track access, and gather broad
            demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not
            linked to personally identifiable information. However, it is
            possible that personal information about a customer may be
            included in the log files due to the normal functions of IP
            addresses and Web browsing.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Customer Surveys:</strong> We may use the contact and other
            information provided to follow up with you to help resolve issues
            internally or with our third party partners. For example, we may
            contact you based on their survey answers or to highlight certain
            changes we made in response to your feedback.
          </p>

          <h3>Disclosing Information</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Partners and Sponsors:</strong> Some of our products or
            services are offered or promoted in conjunction with a partner or
            sponsor, or another brand or company within our corporate family.
            We may share your information with these parties to offer the
            product or service or to facilitate your use of additional
            amenities included with your VEHICULR account. For example, one of
            our partners may provide services to you based on links that you
            access from your control panel.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may also disclose aggregate, anonymous data based on
            information collected from users to potential partners, reputable
            third parties and other companies or brands within our corporate
            family. We will only share your information with third parties
            that agree to maintain your information in confidence and to use
            it solely for purposes of providing the product or service as
agreed to by us.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Service Providers:</strong> We may transfer (or otherwise
            make available) your personal information to third parties that
            help us provide our services or provide services on our behalf.
            For example, we may use service providers to authorize and process
            payments, administer surveys, or run promotions. Your personal
            information may be maintained and processed by our third party
            service providers in the United States or in other jurisdictions.
            Our service providers are given the information they need to
            perform their designated functions, and we do not authorize them
            to use or disclose personal information for their own marketing or
            other purposes.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Online Advertisements:</strong> We do not share personally
            identifiable information about you with advertisers. We may
            display online advertisements and we may share aggregated and
            non-identifying information about you that we collect through the
            registration process or through online surveys and promotions with
            certain advertisers. In some instances, we use this aggregated and
            non-identifying information to deliver tailored advertisements.
            For example, an advertiser may tell us the audience they want to
            reach (e.g., males between 25 and 55 years of age) and provide us
            with an advertisement tailored to the audience. Based upon the
            aggregated and non-identifying information we have collected, we
            may then display the advertisement to the intended audience.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Customer Surveys:</strong> We may share information
            obtained from customer surveys within VEHICULR and our corporate
            family, and with trusted third parties to develop or provide
            products and services that we believe would be of interest to you.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Domain Registration:</strong> In certain jurisdictions or
            pursuant to the rules of the Internet Corporation for Assigned
            Names and Numbers (“ICANN”) or certain registries, the contact
            information you provide to register a domain name (“Domain Name
            Registration Information”) has to be made available and accessible
            to the public through a “WHOIS” search. The WHOIS database is a
            publicly accessible database that lists the Domain Name
            Registration Information for a particular domain name, the name
            server(s) to which the domain name points, and the domain name’s
            creation and expiration date. The Domain Name Registration
            Information you provide is hosted by us or a third party service
            provider and is made available to the public through WHOIS
            searches. At times, customers may receive solicitations that
            result from searches of the publicly available WHOIS database by
            other companies or individuals. Any such solicitations or SPAM do
            not come from us and we do not control the use of WHOIS
            information by third parties. Further, pursuant to ICANN rules, we
            are required to make WHOIS data available to any third party that
            enters into a bulk access agreement. While ICANN allows
            individuals to opt-out (using the account management panel, domain
            management console or similar service) of having their WHOIS
            information made available to third parties through bulk access,
            companies, such as ours, businesses, and other organizations do
            not have the ability to opt-out of having their information made
            available to a third party that enters a bulk access agreement. We
            may also deposit your Domain Name Registration Information with a
            third-party escrow provider to comply with ICANN requirements.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Sale of Business:</strong> If VEHICULR is involved in a
            merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a material portion of its
            assets, change in corporate control, or insolvency or bankruptcy
            proceedings, you will be notified via email or a prominent notice
            will be placed on the website of any such change in ownership or
            use of your personal information as well as any choices you may
            have regarding your personal information.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Legal and Compliance Reasons:</strong> We may access,
            preserve and share your information with companies, organizations,
            governmental entities or individuals outside of VEHICULR if we
            believe, in good faith, that the law requires us to do so. This
            may include, but is not limited to, responding to subpoenas, court
            orders or other legal processes (such as law enforcement
            requests). We may also access, preserve and share your information
            as necessary to: (i) establish or exercise our legal rights or
            defend against any legal claim including threatened claims
            involving VEHICULR based on the anonymity of a domain name; (ii)
            investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected fraud or
            other illegal activities; (iii) prevent death or serious physical
            harm to any person; or (iv) investigate violations of our Terms of
            Service.

            <strong>Public Forums:</strong> Please remember that any
            information you may disclose or post on public areas of our
            websites or the Internet, becomes public information. You should

            these public areas. To request removal of your personal
            information from our community forums or testimonials, contact us
            at support@vehiculr.com In some cases, we may not be able to

            know why we are unable to do so.
          </p>

          <h3>Data Security</h3>
          <p>
            We use technical security measures to prevent the loss, misuse,
            alternation or unauthorized disclosure of information under our
            control. We use security measures including and not limited to:
            physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and
            secure the information we collect online. All sensitive
            information is collected on a secure server. When we ask you to
            provide financial information (such as a credit card number) that
            data is protected using Secure Sockets Layer (“SSL”) technology.

          <h3>Changes to this Policy</h3>
          <p>

            collected personal information, we will provide you with thirty
            (30) days’ advance notice prior to the change becoming effective
